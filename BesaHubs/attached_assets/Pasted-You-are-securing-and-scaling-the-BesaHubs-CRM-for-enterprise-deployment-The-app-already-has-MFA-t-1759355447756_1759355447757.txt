You are securing and scaling the BesaHubs CRM for enterprise deployment. 
The app already has MFA, token rotation, PII encryption, audit logs, GDPR workflows, and monitoring. 
Now implement the following next-level features:

1. **Secrets Management**
   - Replace `.env` with integration to a production secret manager (e.g., Vault, Doppler, or AWS Secrets Manager).
   - Ensure secrets rotate automatically and enforce least privilege.
   - Update deployment guide to cover secret manager integration.

2. **PII Key Rotation**
   - Add scheduled ENCRYPTION_KEY rotation process for pgcrypto.
   - Provide a migration script that decrypts with old key, re-encrypts with new key.
   - Document rotation workflow in `/docs/security.md`.

3. **Disaster Recovery**
   - Implement automated daily database backups, encrypted with AES-256.
   - Store backups in a separate storage bucket with checksum validation.
   - Add a restore script and test job to verify integrity weekly.

4. **Advanced Compliance**
   - Map current controls against SOC 2, ISO 27001, and CCPA.
   - Generate `/docs/compliance.md` explaining how each control is satisfied.
   - Add missing items such as data retention policy, vendor risk checklist, and access review process.

5. **DDoS & Bot Mitigation**
   - Add hCaptcha/Cloudflare Turnstile to all public auth endpoints.
   - Extend rate limiting to include request body size and geo-IP blocking.
   - Document how to configure production reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx/Cloudflare) for upstream protection.

6. **Secure Testing**
   - Integrate static application security testing (SAST) with SonarQube or CodeQL.
   - Add dynamic testing (DAST) with OWASP ZAP in CI/CD.
   - Document a red-team style penetration test checklist.

Deliverables:
- Updated code implementing all features above.
- New documentation: `/docs/compliance.md`, updated `/docs/security.md`.
- New scripts: `rotateKeys.js`, `backupDatabase.js`, `restoreDatabase.js`.
- CI/CD workflows for SAST and DAST.
